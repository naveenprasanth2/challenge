Hi Sir/Mam,

Hope all is well.

I have done the assignment and pushed the source code into the path : challenge\src\test\java\ecsdigital\challenge\challenge.java

Prerequisites:

Plz run a .war file (Web Application Resource) as you have shared in the mail. 
driver.get("http://localhost:3000/"); is used. So make sure you are running the WAR in correct port

Run Instructions:

Just run the .pom file by using the command (mvn test)

Note:
Page Object Model is not implemented in this code as we had only very limited functionalities to do.
If POM is really needed , they I can do and push the code.

Thanks in Advance.
